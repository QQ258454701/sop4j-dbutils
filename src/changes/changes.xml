This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the 
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a bugzilla search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
CVS commits.  Set the project.properties' maven.changelog.range 
property to the number of days since the last release.

To regenerate the RELEASE-NOTES.txt:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version=m.n]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

    <release version="2.0" date="2013-??-??" description="Backwards incompatible update of Commons DBUtils
 
 This is the first release of the 2.x branch of the Commons DbUtils package, DbUtils2.
 The motivation for creating DbUtils2 was two-fold: a number of deprecated methods in the original DbUtils, and the desire to support named parameters (DBUTILS-105).
    ">
      <action dev="sebb" type="update" issue="DBUTILS-85">
        In BeanProcessor#isCompatibleType, can Integer.class.isInstance(value) be replaced by value instanceof Integer (etc)?
        Simplified code by using instanceof.
      </action>
      <action dev="sebb" type="fix" issue="DBUTILS-106">
        DBUtils can't build using JDK 1.7 - DriverProxy needs to implement getParentLogger()
        Add dynamic invocation.
